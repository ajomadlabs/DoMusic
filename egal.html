								<h2 class="card__title amber-text text-accent-4">Justin Bieber</h2>
								<p class="card__subtitle amber-text text-accent-4">Life</p>
							</div>
							<div class="card__copy">
								<p>Justin Drew Bieber (/ˈbiːbər/; born March 1, 1994)[3][4] is a Canadian singer and songwriter. After a talent manager discovered him through his YouTube videos covering songs in 2007 and signed to RBMG, Bieber released his debut EP, My World, in late 2009. It was certified platinum in the U.S.[5] He became the first artist to have seven songs from a debut record chart on the Billboard Hot 100.[6] Bieber released his first full-length studio album, My World 2.0, in 2010. It debuted at or near number one in several countries and was certified triple platinum in the U.S.[7] It was preceded by his most successful single to date, "Baby".

Following his debut album, he had his first headlining tour, the My World Tour, released the remix albums My Worlds Acoustic and Never Say Never – The Remixes -- and the 3D biopic-concert film Justin Bieber: Never Say Never. He released his second studio album, Under the Mistletoe, in November 2011, when it debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. Bieber released his third studio album, Believe, in 2012. His fourth studio album Purpose was released in November 2015. His U.S. album and singles sales total 44.7 million.[8][9] On December 16, 2015, his sales were estimated at more than 75 million records worldwide.[10] On February 12, 2016, Bieber's first four albums were released on vinyl for the first time.[11]

He has won numerous fan-voted awards, including American Music Award for Artist of the Year in 2010 and 2012. In his career, he has received three Grammy nominations, winning one for Best Dance Recording for the song "Where Are Ü Now" at the 2016 ceremony. His fan base, dubbed "beliebers", largely consists of early to mid-adolescent girls. He was listed three times by Forbes magazine among the top ten most powerful celebrities in the world in 2011, 2012, and 2013.</p>
								<p>Purpose is the fourth studio album by Canadian singer and songwriter Justin Bieber. It was released on November 13, 2015, by Def Jam Recordings and School Boy Records. It serves as the follow-up to Bieber's third studio album Believe (2012) and was quickly developed after the release of his collection, Journals (2013), which saw him in a more R&B direction. Working throughout a period of almost two years on the album, Bieber struggled to find a musical direction for the record and scrapped it many times.

With the help of personal friend and frequent collaborator Jason "Poo Bear" Boyd, Bieber started to write and record on the album with the idea of doing an inspirational album that could encourage people through uplifting messages in a period of media scrutiny and his involvement in various misdemeanours as well as his tumultuous relationships. Aided by the help of producer Skrillex, which released with partner Diplo and Bieber the top 10 single "Where Are Ü Now" (2015) for their project Jack Ü, Bieber found its sonic direction and worked with the producer in a handful of songs for the album. Purpose was described as a mix of dance-pop, EDM music and R&B, as well as having influences of tropical house in some tracks and live instruments such as acoustic guitars in some others, while being defined as a coming of age album addressing about apologies, faith and recovery. The album received generally favorable reviews from most critics, who praised the consistent sound, noted his artistic growth and deemed it as his best album. Other critics, however, noted that the album focus in excess on his apology requests, which some felt it made the album too serious at times, and found him exponentially fatigued.

The album debuted at number-one on the US Billboard 200, selling 522,000 copies in its first week of release, giving Bieber the largest first-week sales of his career and his sixth number-one album in the United States. Elsewhere, it reached the top of the charts of other eleven countries and the top 10 in the remaining territories. Four singles have been released from the album so far: "What Do You Mean?", "Sorry", "Love Yourself" and "Company". The first three singles achieved international success, reaching number one on the US Billboard Hot 100, which made the first time of his career to have three consecutive number-one singles from the same record, as well as the UK Singles Chart, where the singer broke chart records, and other countries. "Company" was announced as the fourth single from the album on February 19, 2016.[7] To promote the album, Bieber made several televised interviews and performances, as well as released "dance videos" to all of the album's tracks in a project called "Purpose: The Movement". He will also embark on his Purpose World Tour in 2016.</p>

								<h2 class="card__title amber-text text-accent-4">Taylor Swift</h2>
								<p class="card__subtitle amber-text text-accent-4">Life</p>
							</div>
							<div class="card__copy">
								<p>Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Raised in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania, she moved to Nashville, Tennessee, at the age of 14 to pursue a career in country music. She signed with the independent label Big Machine Records and became the youngest songwriter ever signed by the Sony/ATV Music publishing house. The release of Swift's eponymous debut album in 2006 marked the start of her career as a country music singer. Her third single, "Our Song", made her the youngest person to single-handedly write and perform a number-one song on the Hot Country Songs chart.

Swift's second album, Fearless, was released in 2008. Buoyed by the pop crossover success of the singles "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me", Fearless became the best-selling album of 2009 in the United States. The album won four Grammy Awards, making Swift the youngest ever Album of the Year winner. Swift's third and fourth albums, 2010's Speak Now and 2012's Red, both sold more than one million copies within the first week of their U.S release. Speak Now's "Mean" won two Grammy Awards, while Red's singles "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together" and "I Knew You Were Trouble" were successful worldwide. Swift's fifth album, the pop-focused 1989, was released in 2014 and sold more copies in its opening week than any album in the previous 12 years, making Swift the first and only act to have three albums sell more than one million copies in the opening release week. Its singles "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", and "Bad Blood" reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100. The album won three Grammy Awards, with Swift becoming the only female artist to receive the Album of the Year award twice.[5]

Swift is known for narrative songs about her personal experiences. As a songwriter, she has been honored by the Nashville Songwriters Association and the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Swift's other achievements include ten Grammy Awards, one Emmy Award, 22 Billboard Music Awards, 11 Country Music Association Awards, eight Academy of Country Music Awards, and one Brit Award. She is one of the best-selling artists of all time, having sold more than 40 million albums—including 27.1 million in the U.S.—and 130 million single downloads. Swift has also had supporting roles in feature films including Valentine's Day (2010) and The Giver (2014). In 2015, she became the youngest woman ever to be included on Forbes' "100 Most Powerful Women" list, ranking at number 64.</p>
								<p>1989 is the fifth studio album by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. It was released on October 27, 2014, through Big Machine Records. Swift began preparing for the album during the same year which Red was released, and during a significant amount of media scrutiny. Over the course of the two-year songwriting period, she primarily collaborated with producers Max Martin and Shellback—Martin served as the album's executive producer alongside Swift. The album's title was inspired by the pop music scene of the 1980s, particularly Swift's birth year.

The album represents a sonic departure from the country music of her previous albums, and is described by Swift as her "first documented official pop album."[5] In contrast to Swift's previous work, the production of 1989 consists of drum programming, synthesizers, pulsating bass, processed backing vocals, and guitars. 1989 received generally positive reviews from contemporary music critics and it was ranked as one of the best albums of 2014 by several publications, including Billboard, Time, and Rolling Stone.

After debuting at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200, 1989 sold 1.287 million copies during the first week of release. The total U.S. sales figure from the debut week of 1989 was the highest since 2002, and made Swift the first artist to sell one million or more copies of an album in a week-long period for three albums. 1989 eventually became the best-selling album of 2014 in the U.S. market and has sold over 5.7 million copies as of February 2016, while selling 8.6 million worldwide. Seven singles have been released from the set: "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", and "Bad Blood" all reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100, while "Style" peaked at number six, "Wildest Dreams" at number five, and "Out of the Woods" peaking at number 18 in 2014. The first five singles have all reached number one on the Adult Top 40 and Mainstream Top 40 and all have received a multi-platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

1989 won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, making Swift the first and only female credited main artist so far to win the top prize at the ceremony twice with her own works, having previously won in 2010 for Fearless, and her third nomination overall after Red in 2014. The album also won Best Pop Vocal Album, Swift's first victory in the category. The first two singles "Shake It Off" (in 2015) and "Blank Space" (in 2016) were both nominated for Record of the Year, Song of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance. The "Bad Blood" remix featuring Kendrick Lamar was nominated for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance and won the award for Best Music Video.</p>

							<div class="card__copy">
								<p>Justin Randall Timberlake (born January 31, 1981) is an American singer, songwriter, actor, and record producer. He appeared on the television shows Star Search and The All-New Mickey Mouse Club as a child. In the late 1990s, Timberlake rose to prominence as one of the two lead vocalists and youngest member of NSYNC, which eventually became one of the best-selling boy bands of all time. They released the albums NSYNC (1998), No Strings Attached (2000), and Celebrity (2001). During the group's hiatus, Timberlake released his debut solo album, the R&B-focused Justified (2002), which included the successful singles "Cry Me a River" and "Rock Your Body", and earned his first two Grammy Awards.

His second record, FutureSex/LoveSounds (2006), distinguished from his previous release by its wide range of musical influences, received highly positive reviews from critics, debuted atop the US Billboard 200 and produced the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles "SexyBack", "My Love", and "What Goes Around... Comes Around". With his first two albums exceeding sales of 10 million copies worldwide, he was established as one of the most commercially successful singers of the decade. He also has collaborated with other artists, including "Give It to Me" (with Timbaland) and "4 Minutes" (with Madonna). From 2008 through 2012, Timberlake focused on his acting career, effectively putting his music career on hiatus; he held starring roles in the films The Social Network, Bad Teacher, In Time, and Friends with Benefits.

In 2013, Timberlake resumed his music career with his third and fourth albums The 20/20 Experience and The 20/20 Experience – 2 of 2, exploring neo soul styles with the song structures of 1960s and 1970s rock. The former became the best-selling album of the year in the US with the largest sales week, and spawned the top-three singles "Suit & Tie" and "Mirrors", while the latter produced the top-ten song "Not a Bad Thing". Time named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2007 and 2013. Timberlake's work has earned him numerous awards, including nine Grammy Awards and four Emmy Awards, the latter being for his appearances on Saturday Night Live. His other ventures include record label Tennman Records, fashion label William Rast, and the restaurants Destino and Southern Hospitality.</p>

								<p>Adele is an English singer and songwriter. After signing a contract with record label XL Recordings in September 2006, Adele began to work on her debut studio album, 19, which was ultimately released in 2008.[1] At this time, the singer contributed guest vocals on the song "My Yvonne" for Jack Peñate's debut studio album Matinée (2007).[2] The first single released from 19 was "Chasing Pavements", which Adele wrote in collaboration with Eg White.[3] They co-wrote two other songs for the album: "Melt My Heart to Stone" and "Tired".[3] She also collaborated with Sacha Skarbek on the single "Cold Shoulder" and recorded a cover version of Bob Dylan's "Make You Feel My Love".[3] However, most of the songs were written solely by Adele, including "Best for Last", "Crazy for You", "First Love", and "My Same", as well as her debut single, "Hometown Glory".[3]

Adele appeared as a featured artist on another song by Peñate entitled "Every Glance" from his second studio album Everything Is New,[4] and on Daniel Merriweather's "Water and a Flame" from his second studio album Love & War.[5] Both collaborations were released in 2009. Adele released her second studio album 21 in 2011.[6] In addition to reuniting with writers with whom she had previously worked, the singer collaborated with several new writers and producers. The album's lead single, "Rolling in the Deep", was co-written by Adele and Paul Epworth.[7] It has since been certified seven-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA),[8] and won two awards at the 54th Grammy Awards: for Record of the Year and Song of the Year.[9] Adele and Epworth also wrote "He Won't Go" and "I'll Be Waiting".[7] Adele collaborated with Dan Wilson on the album's second single "Someone Like You"; she co-wrote "Set Fire to the Rain" with Fraser T Smith and with Ryan Tedder on "Rumour Has It" and "Turning Tables".[7] She reunited with White on the song "Take It All".[7] Adele released "Skyfall" in October 2012, a song co-written with Epworth for the James Bond film of the same name.[10] Her third album 25 was released in 2015. She co-wrote its songs "I Miss You" and "Sweetest Devotion" with Epworth while co-writing "Hello", "Million Years Ago", and "Water Under the Bridge" with Greg Kurstin.</p>
